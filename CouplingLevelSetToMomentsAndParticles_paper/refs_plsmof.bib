The flow field is discretized by a conservative finite difference approximation on a stationary grid, and the interface is explicitly represented by a separate, unstructured grid that moves through the stationary grid. Since the interface deforms continuously, it is necessary to restructure its grid as the calculations proceed. In addition to keeping the density and viscosity stratification sharp, the tracked interface provides a natural way to include surface tension effects. Both two- and three-dimensional, full numerical simulations of bubble motion are presented.}

The method is based on a finite difference approximation of the heat equation and explicit tracking of the liquid–solid interface. Discontinuities in material properties between solid and liquid phases as well as topology changes and interfacial anisotropies are easily handled. The accuracy of the method is verified through comparison with exact solutions to a two-dimensional Stefan problem. Convergence under grid refinement is demonstrated for dendritic solidification problems. Experimentally observed complex dendritic structures such as liquid trapping, tip-splitting, side branching, and coarsening are reproduced. We also show that a small increase in the liquid to solid volumetric heat capacity ratio markedly increases the solid growth rate and interface instability.}

When applied at sub-angstrom length scales the phase field crystal (PFC) model is able to describe thermally averaged atomic configurations of defects and defect processes on diffusional timescales. When applied at individual defect levels the microscopic phase field (MPF) model is a superset of the Cahn–Hilliard description of chemical inhomogeneities and the Peierls (cohesive zone) description of displacive inhomogeneities. A unique feature associated with the MPF model is its ability to predict fundamental properties of individual defects such as size, formation energy, saddle point configuration and activation energy of defect nuclei, and the micromechanisms of their mutual interactions, directly using ab initio calculations as model inputs. When applied at the mesoscopic level the coarse grained phase field (CGPF) models have the ability to predict the evolution of microstructures consisting of a large assembly of both chemically and mechanically interacting defects through coupled displacive and diffusional mechanisms. It is noted that the purpose of the MPF model is fundamentally different from that of the CGPF models. The latter have been used primarily to study microstructural evolution with user-supplied linear response rate laws, defect energies and mobilities. Combined phase field simulations hold great promise in modeling deformation and fracture with complex microstructural and chemical interactions.}

Over the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to the simulation of the multiphase flow by using the SPH method. In this review, recent advances in SPH for simulating the multiphase flow are reviewed. Firstly, the basic concept of SPH is briefly introduced. Attention is then paid to how to treat the pressure of incompressible flow, boundary condition and the surface tension in SPH. In addition, modeling free surface flow is briefly introduced. The modified interfacial models and their applications in handling high density ratio are addressed. Finally, a summary of SPH in the application of the multiphase flow is given.}

This method retains the robust topological properties of the level set method with- out the adverse effects of numerical dissipation. Both the level set method and the particle level set method typically use high order accurate numerical discretizations in time and space, e.g. TVD Runge–Kutta and HJ-WENO schemes. We demonstrate that these computationally expensive schemes are not required. Instead, fast, low order accurate numerical schemes suffice. That is, the addition of particles to the level set method not only removes the difficulties associated with numerical diffusion, but also alleviates the need for computationally expensive high order accurate schemes. We use an efficient, first order accurate semi-Lagrangian advection scheme coupled with a first order accurate fast marching method to evolve the level set function. To accurately track the underlying flow characteristics, the particles are evolved with a second order accurate method. Since we avoid complex high order accurate numerical methods, extending the algorithm to arbitrary data structures becomes more feasible, and we show preliminary results obtained with an octree-based adaptive mesh."

Phys. 183 (2002) 83–116.] can substantially improve the mass conservation property of the level set method by using Lagrangian marker particles to correct the level set function in the under-resolved regions. In this study, the limitations of the particle level set method due to the errors introduced in the particle correction process are analyzed, and an improved particle correction procedure is developed based on a new interface reconstruction scheme. Moreover, the zero level set is “anchored” as the level set functions are reinitialized; hence the additional particle correction after the level set reinitialization is avoided. With this new scheme, a well-defined zero level set can be obtained and the disturbances to the interface are significantly reduced. Consequently, the particle reseeding operation will barely result in the loss of interface characteristics and can be applied as frequently as necessary. To demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, two extreme particle reseeding strategies, one without reseeding and the other with reseeding every time step, are applied in several benchmark advection tests and the results are compared with each other. Three interfacial flow cases, a 2D surface tension driven oscillating droplet, a 2D gas bubble rising in a quiescent liquid, and a 3D drop impact onto a liquid pool are simulated to illustrate the advantages of the current method over the level set and the original particle level set methods with regard to the smoothness of geometric properties and mass conservation in real physical applications."

In which, a level set function is utilized to smooth physical properties of the interface, while one-layer Lagrangian particles are used to track the interface directly. This method exhibits excellent mass conservation properties compared to the LS method. As a special aspect, the OPLS method enables management of merging and stretching of interface in an effective way. This capability is similar to the particle level set (PLS) method. However, the new approach of the OPLS method offers a more straightforward technique. This approach is validated with classical benchmark test cases, such as the long term advection of a circle, rotation of a slotted disk, single vertex in a box, merging and separating of circle.

abstract = {Abstract In this work we propose a new Eulerian method for handling the dynamics of a liquid and its surface attributes (for example its color). Our approach is based on a new method for interface advection that we term the Marker Level Set (MLS). The MLS method uses surface markers and a level set for tracking the surface of the liquid, yielding more efficient and accurate results than popular methods like the Particle Level Set method (PLS). Another novelty is that the surface markers allow the MLS to handle non-diffusively surface texture advection, a rare capability in the realm of Eulerian simulation of liquids. We present several simulations of the dynamical evolution of liquids and their surface textures.},

abstract = "A novel multiple marker level-set method is introduced for Direct Numerical Simulation of deformable fluid particles (bubbles and droplets), which is integrated in a finite-volume framework on collocated unstructured grids. Each fluid particle is described by a separate level-set function, thus, different interfaces can be solved in the same control volume, avoiding artificial and potentially unphysical coalescence of fluid particles. Therefore, bubbles or droplets are able to approach each other closely, within the size of one grid cell, and can even collide. The proposed algorithm is developed in the context of the conservative level-set method, whereas, surface tension is modeled by the continuous surface force approach. The pressure–velocity coupling is solved by the fractional-step projection method. For validation of the proposed numerical method, the gravity-driven impact of a droplet on a liquid–liquid interface is studied; then, the binary droplet collision with bouncing outcome is examined, and finally, it is applied on simulation of gravity-driven bubbly flow in a vertical column."

The method is shown to be less restrictive in terms of CFL conditions than split Volume-of-Fluid methods. Various geometric integration schemes are proposed and tested. For linear velocity fields, mass error is shown to vanish, and to be third order otherwise. The method is validated on 2D and 3D test cases.

The numerical dissipation inherent in the Volume-of-Fluid treatment of the convective transport is localized in the interface vicinity, enabling the use of a kinetic energy conserving discretization away from the singularity. Two- and three-dimensional tests are presented, and the solutions shown to remain accurate at arbitrary density ratios. The proposed method is then successfully used to perform the detailed simulation of a round water jet emerging in quiescent air, therefore suggesting the applicability of the proposed algorithm to the computation of realistic turbulent atomization.}

Most approaches within a volume-of-fluid (VOF) framework do not estimate curvature directly from the VOF function, but instead from a smoothly-varying function derived from some mapping (e.g., convolution, discrete quadrature) of the VOF function. In this study we assess and compare the accuracy and robustness of curvature estimates derived from three smooth, VOF-based functions: a convolved VOF (CV) function, a height function (HF), and a reconstructed distance function (RDF). The methodology used in reconstructing a distance function from volume fractions is new and therefore presented in detail along with an analysis of the resulting sensitivities. We find that curvature estimates derived from the height function provide superior results, as measured in smaller error and higher (second-order) convergence rate. While curvature estimates from the RDF provides smaller errors relative to those derived from the CV, both techniques exhibit similar convergence behaviour. Numerical results, including a new cosine wave verification test, are presented to substantiate the findings.}

We have extended these methodologies to interfaces near solid surfaces; specifically, we show how height functions can be used to enforce a contact angle boundary condition at a contact line, for the full range of contact angles. As such, this work may be viewed as following up on the methodology of Renardy et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 2001; 171:243–263). This approach yields accurate values of curvature and the surface tension force at contact lines, values that converge with mesh refinement. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated using 2D examples of static fluid configurations in equilibrium and dynamic contact line phenomena that approach known equilibrium configurations.

abstract = {The subject of this paper is the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a region containing immersed boundaries which move with the fluid and exert forces on the fluid. An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the δ function is introduced. Because the boundary forces are of order h−1, and because they are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method which takes into account the displacements that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve.}

The main elements in a standard ALE simulation are an explicit Lagrangian phase in which the solution and grid are updated, a rezoning phase in which a new grid is defined, and a remapping phase in which the Lagrangian solution is transferred (conservatively interpolated) onto the new grid. In standard ALE methods the new mesh from the rezone phase is obtained by moving grid nodes without changing connectivity of the mesh. Such rezone strategy has its limitation due to the fixed topology of the mesh. In our new method we allow connectivity of the mesh to change in rezone phase, which leads to general polygonal mesh and allows to follow Lagrangian features of the mesh much better than for standard ALE methods. Rezone strategy with reconnection is based on using Voronoi tessellation. We demonstrate performance of our new method on series of numerical examples and show it superiority in comparison with standard ALE methods without reconnection.}

abstract = {The development of numerical methods for the direct numerical simulation of two-phase flows with phase change, in the framework of interface capturing or interface tracking methods, is the main topic of this study. We propose a novel numerical method, which allows dealing with both evaporation and boiling at the interface between a liquid and a gas. Indeed, in some specific situations involving very heterogeneous thermodynamic conditions at the interface, the distinction between boiling and evaporation is not always possible. For instance, it can occur for a Leidenfrost droplet; a water drop levitating above a hot plate whose temperature is much higher than the boiling temperature. In this case, boiling occurs in the film of saturated vapor which is entrapped between the bottom of the drop and the plate, whereas the top of the water droplet evaporates in contact of ambient air. The situation can also be ambiguous for a superheated droplet or at the contact line between a liquid and a hot wall whose temperature is higher than the saturation temperature of the liquid. In these situations, the interface temperature can locally reach the saturation temperature (boiling point), for instance near a contact line, and be cooler in other places. Thus, boiling and evaporation can occur simultaneously on different regions of the same liquid interface or occur successively at different times of the history of an evaporating droplet. Standard numerical methods are not able to perform computations in these transient regimes, therefore, we propose in this paper a novel numerical method to achieve this challenging task. Finally, we present several accuracy validations against theoretical solutions and experimental results to strengthen the relevance of this new method.}

In the first study, 1g pressurization of a simulant low-boiling point fluid in a small scale transparent tank is considered in the context of the Zero-Boil-Off Tank (ZBOT) Experiment to showcase the relatively strong capability that we have developed in modelling the coupling between the convective transport and stratification in the bulk phases with the interfacial evaporative and condensing heat and mass transfer that ultimately control self-pressurization in the storage tank. Here, we show that computational predictions exhibit excellent temporal and spatial fidelity under the moderate Ra number – high Bo number convective-phase distribution regimes. In the second example, we focus on 1g pressurization and pressure control of the large-scale K-site liquid hydrogen tank experiment where we show that by crossing fluid types and physical scales, we enter into high Bo number – high Ra number flow regimes that challenge our ability to predict turbulent heat and mass transfer and their impact on the tank pressurization correctly, especially, in the vapor domain. In the final example, we examine pressurization results from the small scale simulant fluid Tank Pressure Control Experiment (TCPE) performed in microgravity to underscore the fact that in crossing into a low Ra number – low Bo number regime in microgravity, the temporal evolution of the phase front as affected by the time-dependent residual gravity and impulse accelerations becomes an important consideration. In this case detailed acceleration data are needed to predict the correct rate of tank self-pressurization.}

It is developed for the general vaporization problem [1] which solves the vaporization rate based as from the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the liquid-gas system. This includes the commonly studied vaporization regimes of film boiling and isothermal evaporation. The framework is built upon a Cartesian grid solver for low-Mach, turbulent flows [2] which has been modified to handle multiphase flows with large density ratios [3]. Interface transport is performed using an unsplit volume of fluid solver [4]. A novel, divergence-free extrapolation technique is used to create a velocity field that is suitable for interface transport. Sharp treatments are used for the vapor mass fractions and temperature fields [5]. The pressure Poisson equation is treated using the Ghost Fluid Method [6]. Interface equilibrium at the interface is computed using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and is coupled to the flow solver using a monotone, unconditionally stable scheme. It will be shown that correct prediction of the interface properties is fundamental to accurate simulations of the vaporization process. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed numerical framework is verified against solutions in one, two, and three dimensions. The simulations recover first order convergence under temporal and spatial refinement for the general vaporization problem. The work is concluded with a demonstration of unsteady vaporization of a droplet at intermediate Reynolds number.}

This approach allows taking into account characteristics of small droplet evaporation, where heat and mass transfer processes are not described by the regular diffusion model. The results of computations of the evaporation of free water droplets of different sizes according to regular diffusion and emission-diffusion models are compared. The effect of free convection flow and radiative heat transfer on droplets evaporation is determined. The suggested model is validated by comparison with experimental data obtained at the evaporation of water droplets suspended on polypropylene monofilaments. The form of droplet during evaporation is detected by microphotographing. The temperature of its surface is measured using infrared thermography.

In such flows it is not necessary to calculate the velocity and temperature fields in the vapor (or gas). This feature simplifies the solution of the problem and permits the computational effort to be focussed on the temperature field, upon which the interfacial mass flux is critically dependent. The interface is described by a level set method modified with a high-order “subcell fix” with excellent mass conservation properties. The use of irregular stencils is avoided by suitably extrapolating the velocity and temperature fields in the vapor region. Since the accurate computation of momentum effects does not require the same grid refinement as that of the temperature field, the velocity field is interpolated on a finer grid used for the temperature calculation. Several validation and grid refinement axi-symmetric tests are described which demonstrate the intended first-order time, second-order space accuracy of the method. As an illustration of the capabilities of the computational procedure, the growth and subsequent collapse of a laser-generated vapor bubble in a microtube are described.}

A computationally efficient and second-order VOF reconstruction method is presented which uses no inversions to determine the interface normal direction. Next, the lack of conservation of fluid volume in previous VOF advection methods are shown to be due to improper treatment of one-dimensional stretching in the velocity field. This paper uses simple explicit time stepping and a cell-center estimate of the volume fraction in the dilatation term to achieve a completely conservative advection method. The new methods are simple, robust and shown to out perform existing approaches for canonical test problems relevant to breaking wave flows.}

Parallel performance is characterized for two adaptive problems solving hyperbolic conservation laws on up to 512 processors of the IBM ASCI Blue Pacific system. Results reveal good scaling for numerical and data communication operations but poorer scaling in adaptive meshing and communication schedule construction phases of the calculations. We analyze the costs of these different operations, addressing key concerns for scaling SAMR computations to large numbers of processors, and discuss potential changes to improve our current implementation.},

Arbitrary 3-D objects can be represented to any specified resolution in a hierarchical 8-ary tree structure or “octree” Objects may be concave or convex, have holes (including interior holes), consist of disjoint parts, and possess sculptured (i.e., “free-form”) surfaces. The memory required for representation and manipulation is on the order of the surface area of the object. A complexity metric is proposed based on the number of nodes in an object's tree representation. Efficient (linear time) algorithms have been developed for the Boolean operations (union, intersection and difference), geometric operations (translation, scaling and rotation), N-dimensional interference detection, and display from any point in space with hidden surfaces removed. The algorithms require neither floating-point operations, integer multiplications, nor integer divisions. In addition, many independent sets of very simple calculations are typically generated, allowing implementation over many inexpensive high-bandwidth processors operating in parallel. Real time analysis and manipulation of highly complex situations thus becomes possible.}

abstract = {An Eulerian approach to fluid flow provides an efficient, stable paradigm for realistic fluid simulation. However, its traditional reliance on a fixed-resolution grid is not ideal for simulations that simultaneously exhibit both large and small-scale fluid phenomena. Octree-based fluid simulation approaches have provided the needed adaptivity, but the inherent weakness of a pointer-based tree structure has limited their effectiveness. We present a linear octree structure that provides a significant runtime speedup using these octree-based simulation algorithms. As memory prices continue to decline, we leverage additional memory when compared to traditional octree structures to provide this improvement. In addition to reducing the level of indirection in the data, because our linear octree is stored contiguously in memory as a simple Carray rather than a recursive set of pointers, we provide a more cache-friendly data layout than a traditional octree. In our testing, our approach yielded run-times that were 1.5 to nearly 5 times faster than the same simulations running on a traditional octree implementation.},

abstract = {We present a particle method for estimating the curvature of interfaces in volume-of-fluid simulations of multiphase flows. The method is well suited for under-resolved interfaces, and it is shown to be more accurate than the parabolic fitting that is employed in such cases. The curvature is computed from the equilibrium positions of particles constrained to circular arcs and attracted to the interface. The proposed particle method is combined with the method of height functions at higher resolutions, and it is shown to outperform the current combinations of height functions and parabolic fitting. The algorithm is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement on new and existing software frameworks for multiphase flow simulations thus enhancing their capabilities in challenging flow problems. We evaluate the proposed hybrid method on a number of two- and three-dimensional benchmark flow problems and illustrate its capabilities on simulations of flows involving bubble coalescence and turbulent multiphase flows.}

abstract = {We present an adaptive coupled level-set/volume-of-fluid (ACLSVOF) method for interfacial flow simulations on unstructured triangular grids. At each time step, we evolve both the level set function and the volume fraction. The level set function is evolved by solving the level set advection equation using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The volume fraction advection is performed using a Lagrangian–Eulerian method. The interface is reconstructed based on both the level set and the volume fraction information. In particular, the interface normal vector is calculated from the level set function while the line constant is determined by enforcing mass conservation based on the volume fraction. Different from previous works, we have developed an analytic method for finding the line constant on triangular grids, which makes interface reconstruction efficient and conserves volume of fluid exactly. The level set function is finally reinitialized to the signed distance to the reconstructed interface. Since the level set function is continuous, the normal vector calculation is easy and accurate compared to a classic volume-of-fluid method, while tracking the volume fraction is essential for enforcing mass conservation. The method is also coupled to a finite element based Stokes flow solver. The code validation shows that our method is second order and mass is conserved very accurately. In addition, owing to the adaptive grid algorithm we can resolve complex interface changes and interfaces of high curvature efficiently and accurately.}

abstract = {A new, second-order accurate, volume conservative, material-order-independent interface reconstruction method for multi-material flow simulations is presented. First, materials are located in multi-material computational cells using a piecewise linear reconstruction of the volume fraction function. These material locator points are then used as generators to reconstruct the interface with a weighted Voronoi diagram that matches the volume fractions. The interfaces are then improved by minimizing an objective function that smoothes interface normals while enforcing convexity and volume constraints for the pure material subcells. Convergence tests are shown demonstrating second-order accuracy. Static and dynamic examples are shown illustrating the superior performance of the method over existing material-order-dependent methods.}

author = {John Strain},
abstract = {A new numerical method for solving geometric moving interface problems is presented. The method combines a level set approach and a semi-Lagrangian time stepping scheme which is explicit yet unconditionally stable. The combination decouples each mesh point from the others and the time step from the CFL stability condition, permitting the construction of methods which are efficient, adaptive, and modular. Analysis of a linear one-dimensional model problem suggests a surprising convergence criterion which is supported by heuristic arguments and confirmed by an extensive collection of two-dimensional numerical results. The new method computes correct viscosity solutions to problems involving geometry, anisotropy, curvature, and complex topological events.}

We present a method that replaces the original minimization stage by an analytic reconstruction algorithm on bi-dimensional Cartesian grids. This algorithm provides accurate results for a lower computational cost than the original minimization algorithm. When more than two fluids are involved, this algorithm can be used coupled with the minimization algorithm. Although this paper deals with Cartesian grids, everything remains valid for any meshes that are made of rectangular cells.}

This work demonstrates how a physics-informed neural network promotes the combination of traditional governing equations and advanced interface evolution equations without intricate algorithms. We develop physics-informed neural networks for the phase-field method (PF-PINNs) in two-dimensional immiscible incompressible two-phase flow. The Cahn–Hillard equation and Navier–Stokes equations are encoded directly into the residuals of a fully connected neural network. Compared with the traditional interface-capturing method, the phase-field model has a firm physical basis because it is based on the Ginzburg–Landau theory and conserves mass and energy. It also performs well in two-phase flow at the large density ratio. However, the high-order differential nonlinear term of the Cahn–Hilliard equation poses a great challenge for obtaining numerical solutions. Thus, in this work, we adopt neural networks to tackle the challenge by solving high-order derivate terms and capture the interface adaptively. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of PF-PINNs, we use the time-marching strategy and the forced constraint of the density and viscosity. The PF-PINNs are tested by two cases for presenting the interface-capturing ability of PINNs and evaluating the accuracy of PF-PINNs at the large density ratio (up to 1000). The shape of the interface in both cases coincides well with the reference results, and the dynamic behavior of the second case is precisely captured. We also quantify the variations in the center of mass and increasing velocity over time for validation purposes. The results show that PF-PINNs exploit the automatic differentiation without sacrificing the high accuracy of the phase-field method.}",

The Continuous MOF (CMOF) method is motivated in this article. The CMOF reconstruction method inherently removes the “checkerboard instability” that persists when using the MOF method on surface tension driven multiphase (multimaterial) flows. The CMOF reconstruction algorithm is accelerated by coupling the CMOF method to the level set method and coupling the CMOF method to a decision tree machine learning (ML) algorithm. Multiphase flow examples are shown in the two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) axisymmetric “RZ”, and 3D coordinate systems.

In this work, the multimaterial moment-of-fluid interface representation technique is applied to simulating surface tension effects at points where three materials meet. The advection terms are solved using a directionally split cell integrated semi-Lagrangian algorithm, and the projection method is used to evaluate the pressure gradient force term. The underlying computational grid is a dynamic block-structured adaptive grid. The new method is applied to multiphase problems illustrating contact-line dynamics, triple junctions, and encapsulation in order to demonstrate its capabilities. Examples are given in two-dimensional, three-dimensional axisymmetric (R–Z), and three-dimensional (X–Y–Z) coordinate systems. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A wide variety of interface capturing methods have been introduced for simulating two-phase flows throughout the years. However, there is a noticeable dearth of literature focusing on objective comparisons between these methods, especially when they are coupled to the momentum equation and applied in physically relevant regimes. In this article, we compare two techniques for simulating two-phase flows that possess attractive qualities, but belong to the two distinct classes of diffuse interface (DI) and volume of fluid (VOF) methods. Both of these methods allow for mass-conserving schemes that can naturally capture large interfacial topology changes omnipresent in realistic two phase flows. The DI solver used in this work is based on a conservative and bounded phase field method, developed recently. Similar to level set methods, this diffuse interface method takes advantage of the smoothness of the phase field in computing curvature and surface tension forces. Geometric VOF methods track the fractional tagged volume in a cell. The specific geometric VOF scheme used here is a discretely conservative and bounded implementation that uses geometric algorithms for unsplit advection and interface reconstruction, while employing height functions for normal and curvature calculation. We present a quantitative comparison of these methods on Cartesian meshes in terms of their accuracy, convergence rate, and computational cost using canonical two-dimensional (2D) two-phase test cases: an equilibrium static drop, an oscillating drop, damped surface wave and the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. We further compare these methods in their ability to resolve thin films by simulating the impact of a water drop on a deep water pool. Using results of these studies, we suggest qualitative guidelines for selection of schemes for two-phase flow calculations.}

abstract = {We present a novel N-phase extension to the second-order conservative phase field method, first introduced by Chiu and Lin [1]. The proposed N-phase model is in conservative form and is symmetric with respect to the phases while satisfying volume conservation. The model is reduction consistent, meaning that in the absence of M phases, the equations reduce to the equations for an N−M-phase flow. This eliminates the possibility of fictitious phases appearing. For coupling to momentum transport, we extend the two-phase mass-momentum consistent model to N-phase flows. By adopting second-order central spatial schemes, the boundedness properties of the two-phase model are inherited by the N-phase model, and the coupled mass-momentum consistent N-phase flow solver inherits the conservation properties of its two-phase version, resulting in the first N-phase flow method that analytically and discretely conserves mass, momentum and kinetic energy (in the absence of capillary and viscous effects). A novel surface tension model is proposed for modeling surface tension forces in N-phase flows. The phase field model allows for variable interface thicknesses between different phase pairs. This endows the model with the property of attaining correct equilibirum configurations at triple junction points. Specifically, we analytically demonstrate that by using interfacial thicknesses that are inversely proportional with the pairwise surface tension, the coupled system achieves steady state at the correct configuration. Using several canonical and practical numerical tests, we demonstrate the accuracy of the phase field equation, the surface tension model, and the fully coupled N-phase flow solver.}

The improved method ensures discrete conservation by introducing a correction of the projected cells, which is similar to the three-dimensional cell-based method of Comminal and Spangenberg [J. Comput. Phys. 442 (2021) 110479] [28], developed in parallel to this work. While the cell projection is performed as in the method of Le Chenadec and Pitsch, additional vertices are introduced to correct the projected cells. The positions of those are obtained from conservative flux volumes, which was inspired from the work of Owkes and Desjardins [J. Comput. Phys. 270 (2014) 587-612] [25]. The improved method is tested in two- and three-dimensional benchmark cases and compared to literature methods. Moreover, the improved method is applied in the simulation of a realistic coaxial liquid-gas primary atomization case, which suffered from large conservation errors when the method of Le Chenadec and Pitsch was applied.}

The material volume and centroid are advected in a face-flux based approach which guarantees the conservation of the advected quantities. The face-flux based advection avoids material overlap and void formation between the advected material volumes. The centroid advection of a material volume is computed by advecting the individual centroids of smaller subvolumes. Hence, the proposed procedure reduces the centroid advection error which is proportional to the size of the material volume. Also, the multi-directional advection enables two-phase simulations over unstructured meshes. A two-phase flow solver with the proposed method is used successfully to study film boiling and condensation phenomena.}

abstract = {We present a novel Front-Tracking method, the Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method for multiphase flow simulations. In the EBIT method, the markers are located on the grid edges and the interface can be reconstructed without storing the connectivity of the markers. This feature makes the process of marker addition or removal easier than in the traditional Front-Tracking method. The EBIT method also allows almost automatic parallelization due to the lack of explicit connectivity. In a previous journal article we have presented the kinematic part of the EBIT method, that includes the algorithms for piecewise linear reconstruction and advection of the interface. Here, we complete the presentation of the EBIT method and combine the kinematic algorithm with a Navier–Stokes solver. A circle fit is now implemented to improve the accuracy of mass conservation in the reconstruction phase. Furthermore, to identify the reference phase and to distinguish ambiguous topological configurations, we introduce a new feature: the Color Vertex. For the coupling with the Navier–Stokes equations, we first calculate volume fractions from the position of the markers and the Color Vertex, then viscosity and density fields from the computed volume fractions and finally surface tension stresses with the Height-Function method. In addition, an automatic topology change algorithm is implemented into the EBIT method, making it possible the simulation of more complex flows. The two-dimensional version of the EBIT method has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform, and validated with seven standard test cases: stagnation flow, translation with uniform velocity, single vortex, Zalesak's disk, capillary wave, Rayleigh-Taylor instability and rising bubble. The results are compared with those obtained with the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method already implemented in Basilisk.}
